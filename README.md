"Richmond United" is a fan page website for the football club AFC Richmond, and we are based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

1. **Project Description**

Richmond United is excited to launch a fan page website to bring together AFC Richmond fans from around the world. Through this website, fans will be able to get real-time updates about the club’s upcoming fixtures, transfer and team statistics, and news about the club. This website will also offer exclusive content, such as behind the scenes footage from our games and training sessions, and much more. Besides that, our website also supports three SDGs, which are SDG 17, SDG 3, and SDG 9. It is an honor for us to be involved in this SDG. We are dedicated to providing AFC Richmond’s fans with an interactive and engaging experience, and we are confident that this fan page website will do just that.
